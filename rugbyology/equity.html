                    <p>The launch of Google Translate in 2006 had a monumental impact on the rugby coaching community. While translating text online was available before this, it was only useful for smaller chunks of text. They had to be copied and pasted into a user interface. Google Translate changed this by being able to translate extensive articles and the click of a button.</p>

<p class="impact">Suddenly an entire world of coaching information previously unavailable was accessible to all. Whether it be the work of the great French rugby mind Pierre Villepreux or more relevant to this article, some old text-based articles written by some Portuguese football coaches on EFDeportes, sport and its preparation got much more interesting.</p>
<p>Got a paragraph you <em>really</em> want your readers to see? You could try incorporating some <strong>contextual bolding</strong>—making important words or phrases bold—or you could go all the way with these <strong>content callouts:</strong></p>
<p>Fast forward to 2015, and Tactical Periodisation was having a moment. At least half a dozen books on the topic were published. I can’t recall what came first, the books or the sudden surge in popularity, but within a very short period of time, you couldn’t go anywhere without seeing <span class="s2caps">TP</span> being discussed in the sports coaching community. Not since the sporting community (incorrectly) jumped on Nassim Taleb’s concept of Anti-fragility in early 2013 had an idea become so omnipresent. </p>

<div class="taleb"><span class="taleb-drop_cap">V</span>ery few communities suffer from <strong>Shiny Object Syndrome</strong> like the sports coaching community. The appeal to novelty fallacy, or argumentum ad novitatem, is very real. If it’s new, it must be better right?</div>

<p>Remember one-legged line out lifting? Someone started it, and almost immediately, the entire rugby world was doing it; within 24 months, it was entirely out of the game. Or what about anything the Crusaders have done over the last 20 years? The two pass-and-go counter-attack rule? Their pod structure? </p>
<p><a class="s2caps" href="http://go.com">John didit did it</a></p>
<p>Follow coaches online and you will quickly notice that you can tell what the last book they read was, the last coaching concept they discovered or the last thing they learned.</p>

<p>Equipment can be sold for a minimum <a class="s2caps" href="http://new.com">My name is Hege Refsnes.</a> manufacturers constantly release new gimmicky pieces of rugby equipment. About a decade ago, tackle bags were pretty much out of rugby, at least for players over 12 years of age now, you can’t go on social media without seeing them in use. No one has manufactured one that has the movement and specifications of a player yet, or in other words, a better one. Only newer. </p>

<p>Social media is only making this worse. <span font-variant: small-caps;>Rugby coaching</span> practices have regressed in the last decade. As mentioned, tackle bags have returned, or in some cases, been replaced with humans acting as accurately weighted tackle bags. Jogging alongside crash mats, bracing for contact (sometimes jumping in the air), being lit up. Coaches wonder why their team is conceding 35 points a game. Thanks, Instagram.</p>

<p>In 2015 Tactical Periodisation and everything to do with it was new, at least for the masses, so it had to be better, right?</p>

<p>This “better”, “newer” method spawned an information marketing niche. Sadly, each of these books and resources covering this new method (which was only 30+ years old) did little but parrot those that came before. If you read one of them, you pretty much read them all.</p>

    </div>
<p>One of those blindly parroted fundamentals of Tactical Periodisation is the concept of Moments of Play.</p>

<h2>Moments of the Game</h2>

<p>The Moments of the Game concept is a cornerstone of Tactical Periodisation. Over the years, it has been applied to every sport you can imagine. This alone is strange given that Tactical Periodisation is a periodisation model with an emphasis on specificity, not a program itself. </p>

<p>The Moments defined by the Tactical Periodisation literature are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Attack</li>
	<li>Defense</li>
	<li>Transition Attack</li>
	<li>Transition Defence</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that some cosmetic differences exist between the reference sources, such as Attack sometimes being called “Attack Organisation” and so forth. For all intents and purposes, the terminology is the same and, as I will discuss, irrelevant.</p>

<p>The purpose of the moments is to ensure in every activity during practice and preparation, a moment is present to ensure the element of specificity to said activity.</p>

<h2>The game that changed everything </h2>

<p>In 2015 I watched a rugby match that changed the way I viewed the entire sport and laid the foundations for the Interactive Dynamics Model of Rugby. I turned the coverage on early in the second half and saw the most absurd thing I had ever seen on a rugby field.</p>

<p>The attacking team was tackled about 5m short of the try line and 15m to the right of the uprights. </p>

<p>There was not a single defender to be seen to the left of the tackle area. A good 30m of the try line was completely undefended by anyone. A golden oldies player in the “you can’t tackle me” shorts could have picked up the ball and walked across the try line, untouched. <br/><br/>Now keep in mind this was a reasonably high-level team in a high-level game, what do you think they did next?</p>

<p>You would be correct if you said pass to an isolated, one-off runner to the right of the breakdown. Bonus points if you also guessed that there were eight defenders on that short side to cover the one attacking player.</p>

<p>As you did in 2015, I immediately clipped that phase and took to Twitter.</p>

<p>“This is the worst coaching I’ve seen”, I proclaimed, or at least something similar.</p>

<p>A local coach replied, “That’s not the coaching, that’s the player’s fault”.</p>

<p>I knew if this particular coach disagreed with me, I was 101% correct. So I went back a watched the entire match just to be sure.</p>

<h2>Wait, that’s not a moment!</h2>

<p>Having read at least six books on Tactical Periodisation in the weeks before watching this game, it was certainly top of mind. As a result, I was viewing everything that happened on the field in terms of the moments.</p>

<p>I was right too. The team was poorly coached. Overly structured and predictable in attack. They ran what was essentially an old-school exhaust pattern, and they stuck to it.</p>

<p>At one point, a crash ball burst through the line and ran through open space for about 40m before being taken down by a cover tackle. Predictably, they slowed things down and fell back to their exhaust pattern, killing any chance for a try.</p>

<p>But for a moment, as the player was tackled and there was complete disorganisation from both teams, what was occurring on that pitch was not qualifiable by the Moments of the Game concept.</p>

<h2>Let’s Transition to Transitions</h2>

<p>To understand the real issues with the blanket application of the Moments of the Game concept across sports, we need to look at the moments defined as transitions.</p>

<p>In the majority of Tactical Periodisation resources and the resources born from them, you will see the beginning of a “transition” moment defined as the change of possession. This is a rather simplistic definition but will certainly work as a starting point for this discussion.</p>

<p>When you gain possession in any manner other than a predetermined restart, you are in Transition Attack, when you lose possession in a similar manner, you are in Transition Defence. Again, not a perfect definition but the one that is most commonly used.</p>

<p>The more important question to ask is, when does a Transition Moment end? </p>

<p>This is a question largely ignored in the Tactical Periodisation literature and by the copy-and-paste crowd, but it must be addressed. If the four moments are the four moments, then you must be able to identify when each begins and ends.</p>

<p>The Transition moment must end at some point. Occasionally a team will achieve the attacking objective (eg try/goal) during a transition moment, other times, they might lose possession or commit a penalty. But what about the bulk of the time?</p>

<p>In other words, when does Transition Attack simply become Attack? And when does Transition Defence simply become Defence?</p>

<p>This is the biggest hole in the idea of “Transitions” as moment and the most logical. Unless we consider the game dynamic theory, there is no logical or commonsensical answer to this question in polyphasic sports (like rugby).</p>

<p>I have yet to see a resource attempt to define when the end of a Transition moment occurs. And unfortunately, in this case, the Potter Stewart defence isn’t enough.</p>

<p>While a definition of the Transition phases has been largely ignored, defining Attack and Defence has not.<br/><br/>In his book, <em>Tactical Periodization</em>, Raul Oliveira (not to be confused with Jose Guilherme Oliveira) gives the following simple definitions.</p>

<p>Attack: Moment in ball possession and opposition is organised in the defensive process.</p>

<p>Defence: Moment when the team is organised and prepared to use the adopted defensive method to regain possession.</p>

<p>The key to these definitions is the use of the term ‘organised’. I disagree with this terminology and will discuss that in the future, but for now, it provides a helpful illustration.</p>

<p>This leaves us with the following definitions of the moments.</p>

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>
				Moment
			</th>
			<th>
				State
			</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
				Attack
			</td>
			<td>
				Hold possession, defence organised.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				Defence
			</td>
			<td>
				Not in possession, defence organised.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				Transition Attack
			</td>
			<td>
				Hold possession, defence disorganised.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				Transition Defence
			</td>
			<td>
				Not in possession, defence disorganised.
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Attack: Hold possession, defence organised.</p>

<p>Defence: Not in possession, defence organised.</p>

<p>Transition Attack: Hold possession immediately after a turnover.</p>

<p>Transition Defence: Not in possession immediately after a turnover.<br/><br/>In rugby, significant portions of the game don’t fit into any of these moments. In fact, the fundamental objective of attack is to create a state of disorganisation amongst the defence. This is not represented at all.</p>

<p>Remember the crash ball runner breaking the line I mentioned earlier? When he was eventually brought down, there was no organised defence. There was barely a defence at all. And it certainly wasn’t a result of a transition moment, the team were several phases into an attacking possession.</p>

<p>So why is there confusion?</p>

<p>Simply put Tactical Periodisation and all the related resources were developed by football coaches through a football lens. And the more generally focused, multi-sport resources that touch <span class="s2caps">Tactical Periodisation</span> generally are straight copy-and-paste/plagiarism jobs. Often including the exact quotes and errors that are included in the original Tactical Periodisation resources they are copying.</p>

<p>Coaches then mindlessly assume that what applies to one sport, applies to all. Very little thought is given to the idea that games should be defined by more than the reduction  definition of “invasion games”.</p><div class="bar up-4">This is the bar?</div>

<p>Games should be primarily defined by the interactions of the teams participating in said games and by the environment in which they play. This environment is created by all the conditions of play, including the interaction of said teams.</p>

<h2>The Rugby Codes are Different</h2>

<p>The rugby codes are different to all other invasion games. They are even different amongst themselves, with 15s and 7s being polyphasic and league and touch being mono-phasic.</p>

<p>While it might seem to be a simple law of the game on the surface, the inability to pass the ball forward, or “flip the field” in attack has a fundamental impact on how the game is played and the interactions within it.</p>

<p>There are two foundational differences between the rugby codes and other invasion games caused by the dynamic of interaction between the teams.</p>

<p>The first difference deals with the fundamentals of attacking objectives. You must “beat” the defence to score in the rugby codes. Scoring is a territorial objective. In other invasion games, the objective is goal orientated. You can score with as many as 18 defenders between you and the primary objective or goal.</p>

<p>The second difference deals with the interactive dynamics of the teams involved in a match and is very relevant to this piece.</p>

<p>Consider the “moments of play”. In any other invasion game, the moments flow in a circular and linear pattern. You can start at any point and certainly skip steps, for example, going straight from Attack to Defence or Transition Defence to Transition attack; however, you cannot go backwards within the same possessive state. You cannot, in any realistic scenario, go from attack to transition attack or defence to transition defence; the interactions and the rules of the game do not allow it.</p>

<p>For example, imagine a basketball team set up on attack. The point guard has the ball at the top of the three-point line, her teammates in position around the key, and the defence is organised. This is Attack. There is no scenario where the same team can immediately find themselves in a moment of Transition Attack. </p>

<p>This is not the case in rugby.</p>

<h2>It’s all stench blossoms and crap weeds</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>What&#39;s in a name? That which we call a rose, By any other name would smell as sweet.</p>

<p>Juliet Capulet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is a truth about the “Moments of Play” (and many of the foundations of sport that we “know”). They don’t exist.</p>

<p>That’s right, Attack, Defence, Transition Attack and Transition Defence don’t exist, at least not literally. These are simply reductionist labels used to describe the complex interactions going on within a game.</p>

<p>“Transition” is not a state; it is merely a label applied to the underlying state of interaction.</p>

<h2>Underneath it all</h2>

<p>Let’s take these labels off and consider what is going on underneath. In my Interactive Dynamics Model of Rugby, I go a lot deeper into this, but for now, I’m going to limit it to discuss what is covered in the Tactical Periodisation resources.</p>

<p>Let’s remove the element of time (turnover of possession) and look at the interactions instead. We get something that looks like this.</p>

<p>Attack: Hold possession, defence organised.</p>

<p>Defence: Not is possession, defence organised.</p>

<p>Transition Attack: Hold possession, defence disorganised.</p>

<p>Transition Defence: Not in possession, defence disorganised.</p>

<p>Again, I’m not a fan of the organised/disorganised continuum or any of the other popular terms used, such as order and stability, but they will work for now.</p>

<p>In the majority of invasion games, it is impossible, under normal conditions, to go from having a state of organised defence to a state of disorganised defence without a transfer of possession. This is where the moment of “Transition” originates. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Now consider rugby. Not only is such a change in state possible without a change in possession, but it is also literally the attacking objective of the sport.<br/><br/>The “Transition” moment is not about the turnover. It is about the state, or as I call it, the Interactive Dynamic. </p>

<p>In football, that dynamic/state is not possible without the turnover in possession, so it appears on the surface level to be all about the transition rather than the underlying condition. </p>

<h2>So if Rugby doesn’t have transitions, what does it have?</h2>

<p>If we can identify at least two moments found during a rugby game that are not accounted for by the Tactical Periodisation model, does that mean we have six moments to prepare for?</p>

<p>I argue, no. </p>

<p>Rugby instead has four <em>interactive dynamics</em>, rather than the four moments of the game. When we consider the primary objective of rugby is to score tries, this makes much more sense. Rather than defining the game by simply gaining or losing possession, we define it by its role, function or purpose in achieving that primary objective.</p>

<p>In a later post I will explain these dynamics in detail and the implications they have for coaching practices.</p>
